# Java OOP – Practice Projects from Udemy Course

This repo includes a bunch of **Java exercises focused on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** that I worked on while taking a Udemy course.

## About

The main goal here is to practice and understand the core concepts of OOP using Java, like:

- Encapsulation  
- Constructors  
- Method overloading  
- `getters` and `setters`  
- Object composition  
- Organizing classes and methods  

It’s basically my **personal study space**, not a finished or professional project.

## Course

Based on the Udemy course *“Java 2023 – From Zero to Professional.”*  
📎 *These are exercises and examples that follow the course lessons.*

## Project Structure

The code is organized into packages, usually like this:

- `entities` → Domain classes (e.g., `Product`, `Holder`, etc.)  
- `application` → The `main` class where I run the examples/tests  

## Note

This repo is **just for learning purposes** — some of the code is simple or experimental, since the idea is to learn step by step and get comfortable with OOP in Java.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vicentolah17/JavaUdemy.git
